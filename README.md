The power of room database is immense, it simplifies the interaction between us, developers and the sqlite database.

# But ...
Such power comes with a cost, Room database works best outside the UI thread, which leaves us with a question.

# "What should we use to benifit from this?"

This project will be the summary of my room database experience for anyone who wants to better understand how things work inside
room database and how to deal with it.

Also this project is an open source, so that everyone can contribute to it and make it more useful for everyone.
